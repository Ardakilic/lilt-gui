# Getting Started Checklist

## Immediate Actions Required

- [ ] **Install dependencies** - Run `make install` (or `cd frontend && npm install`)
- [ ] **Replace app icon** - Replace `build/appicon.png` with a real 512x512 PNG icon
- [ ] **Test the setup** - Run `make test` to ensure everything works
- [ ] **Review configurations** - Check `wails.json` and update if needed

## Before First Build

- [ ] Update version in `wails.json` if needed
- [ ] Review and update `README.md` with your repository URL
- [ ] Update GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/build.yml` with correct repo paths
- [ ] Add actual screenshots to README (update Screenshots section)
- [ ] Test build locally with `make build` or `wails build`

## Before First Release

- [ ] Create GitHub repository
- [ ] Push code to GitHub
- [ ] Set up GitHub repository secrets if needed for CI/CD
- [ ] Create first release tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- [ ] Verify GitHub Actions builds all platforms successfully
- [ ] Download and test binaries from release

## Optional Improvements

- [ ] Add more tests to increase coverage
- [ ] Add additional language translations
- [ ] Create user documentation/FAQ
- [ ] Add screenshots/GIFs to README
- [ ] Set up Codecov for coverage reports
- [ ] Create a logo/banner for the project
- [ ] Add dark/light theme toggle
- [ ] Implement additional features from roadmap

## Development Workflow

### First Time Setup
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
make install

# 2. Run tests
make test

# 3. Start development
make dev-frontend  # or wails dev
```

### Regular Development
```bash
# Before coding
git pull
make install  # if package.json changed

# After coding
make lint      # check for issues
make lint-fix  # auto-fix issues
make test      # run tests

# Commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add amazing feature"
git push
```

### Before Committing
- [ ] Run `make lint` and fix any issues
- [ ] Run `make test` and ensure all tests pass
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with your changes
- [ ] Use conventional commit messages
- [ ] Update documentation if needed

## Testing Checklist

### Functionality Tests
- [ ] Can select lilt binary
- [ ] "Identify" button finds lilt in PATH
- [ ] Can toggle Docker mode
- [ ] Can select source directory
- [ ] Can select target directory
- [ ] Can change output format
- [ ] Can toggle metadata preservation
- [ ] Can toggle image copying
- [ ] Transcoding starts and shows output
- [ ] Can stop transcoding mid-process
- [ ] Can clear output console
- [ ] Settings persist across app restarts

### UI Tests
- [ ] All tooltips work
- [ ] All buttons are clickable
- [ ] Language switcher changes all text
- [ ] Help modal opens and closes
- [ ] Download lilt button opens browser
- [ ] All form inputs are accessible
- [ ] Responsive on different window sizes

### Cross-Platform Tests
- [ ] Windows build works
- [ ] macOS Intel build works
- [ ] macOS ARM build works
- [ ] Linux AMD64 build works
- [ ] Linux ARM64 build works

## Known Limitations

- Wails bindings (`wailsjs/`) are mock files for development
  - Real bindings are auto-generated by Wails during `wails dev` or `wails build`
  - Don't modify these files - they'll be overwritten

- TypeScript errors before npm install are expected
  - Will resolve after running `make install`

- Build icon is placeholder text file
  - Must be replaced with actual PNG before building

## Quick Reference

### Make Commands
- `make help` - Show all available commands
- `make install` - Install dependencies
- `make test` - Run tests
- `make lint` - Check code quality
- `make lint-fix` - Auto-fix linting issues
- `make dev-frontend` - Start frontend dev server
- `make build` - Build production app
- `make clean` - Clean build artifacts

### File Locations
- Backend code: `main.go`, `app.go`
- Frontend code: `frontend/src/`
- Tests: `frontend/src/__tests__/`
- Translations: `frontend/src/i18n/locales/`
- Docs: `README.md`, `docs/`
- Config: `wails.json`, `frontend/package.json`
