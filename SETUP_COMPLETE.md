## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Run Automated Setup

```bash
./docker-setup.sh
```

This will:
- ✅ Check Docker is running
- ✅ Install dependencies via Docker
- ✅ Build Tauri Docker image
- ✅ Configure X11 (macOS/Linux)
- ✅ Test the setup

### 2. Start Development

**Option A: Frontend Only** (Fastest):
```bash
make dev-frontend
```
Open http://localhost:1420

**Option B: Full Tauri with GUI** (requires X11):

**macOS**:
```bash
# Install XQuartz: https://www.xquartz.org/
# Configure: Preferences → Security → "Allow connections from network clients"
# Then:
xhost + localhost
make dev-tauri
```

**Linux**:
```bash
xhost + local:docker
make dev-tauri
```

**Option C: All Services**:
```bash
make dev
```

## 📋 Essential Commands

### Development
```bash
make dev-frontend       # Fast UI development (recommended)
make dev-tauri          # Full Tauri with GUI (requires X11)
make dev                # All services together
make quick-dev          # Alias for dev-frontend
```

### Testing
```bash
make test               # Run all tests
make test-coverage      # With coverage report
make test-ui            # Interactive UI (port 51204)
```

### Code Quality
```bash
make lint               # Check code style
make format             # Auto-fix issues
```

### Building
```bash
make build              # Build frontend
make build-tauri        # Build full Tauri app
```

### Utilities
```bash
make help               # Show all commands
make info               # Show project info

## 🎯 Development Workflow

### Daily Development (Recommended)

1. **Start Docker Desktop** (keep it running)

2. **Frontend work** (fastest iteration):
   ```bash
   make dev-frontend
   ```
   - Instant hot reload
   - Lightweight container
   - Best for UI development

3. **Test Rust backend**:
   ```bash
   make dev-tauri
   ```
   - Full native app
   - Test Tauri commands
   - Requires X11 setup

4. **Before committing**:
   ```bash
   make lint
   make test
   ```

## 🔧 Next Steps

### 1. Create App Icons

Current icons are placeholders. Generate real icons:

```bash
# Create a 512x512 PNG image first
make docker-shell
npm install -g @tauri-apps/cli
tauri icon path/to/icon.png
exit
```

Or use online tools:
- https://icon.kitchen/
- https://www.appicon.co/

### 2. Download Lilt Binary

Download from: https://github.com/Ardakilic/lilt/releases/latest

In the app:
1. Click "Browse" to select the binary
2. Or click "Identify" to auto-detect
3. Enable Docker mode (recommended)

### 3. Test the Application

```bash
# Run tests
make test

# Check coverage (should be >80%)
make test-coverage

# Run linter
make lint
```

### 4. Build for Production

```bash
make build-tauri
```

Artifacts in: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`

## 🐳 Docker Tips

### Performance
- Use `make dev-frontend` for UI work (fastest)
- Keep Docker Desktop running
- Docker volumes cache dependencies automatically

### Troubleshooting

**Docker not running?**
```bash
make check-docker
```

**Port already in use?**
```bash
make docker-down
```

**Rebuild everything?**
```bash
make clean
make build-tauri-image
make install
```

**X11 issues on macOS?**
1. Quit and restart XQuartz
2. Run: `xhost + localhost`
3. Verify: `echo $DISPLAY` (should show `:0`)

See **DOCKER_GUIDE.md** for detailed troubleshooting.
