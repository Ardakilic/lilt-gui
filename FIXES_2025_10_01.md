# Recent Fixes - Multiple Issues

## 1. ✅ Fixed All Browse Buttons

### Problem
Browse buttons in the **Binary Configuration** section were not working because the code was missing the Tauri environment check. The folder browse buttons worked (they had the check), but the binary file browse buttons didn't.

### Root Cause
`BinaryConfig.tsx` was directly calling `selectFile()` without checking if Tauri APIs are available. When running in browser dev mode (`make dev-frontend`), Tauri APIs don't exist, causing the buttons to fail silently.

### Solution
Added the same environment detection pattern used in `FolderSelection.tsx`:

```typescript
const handleBrowse = async (field: keyof Settings) => {
  try {
    // Check if we're in Tauri environment
    if (typeof window !== "undefined" && "__TAURI__" in window) {
      const path = await selectFile(t(`binaries.${field}`));
      onSettingsChange({ ...settings, [field]: path });
    } else {
      // In browser dev mode, show an alert
      alert("File dialogs only work in the Tauri app. Use 'make dev-tauri' to test this feature.");
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to select file:", error);
  }
};
```

### Result
- ✅ All browse buttons now show helpful alerts in browser dev mode
- ✅ Full functionality when running in actual Tauri app (`make dev-tauri`)
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all browse buttons

**Files Modified**: `src/components/BinaryConfig.tsx`

## 2. ✅ Removed Unnecessary Install from dev-frontend

### Problem
Running `make dev-frontend` always triggered `make install` first, which:
- Runs `npm install` every time (slow and unnecessary)
- Not needed when `node_modules` already exists
- Wastes time during development

### Solution
Removed `install` as a prerequisite from the `dev-frontend` target in the Makefile:

**Before:**
```makefile
dev-frontend: check-docker install ## Start Vite dev server
```

**After:**
```makefile
dev-frontend: check-docker ## Start Vite dev server
```

### Result
- ✅ `make dev-frontend` starts immediately if dependencies are installed
- ✅ Developers can run `make install` manually when needed
- ✅ Faster development iteration

**Files Modified**: `Makefile`

## 3. ✅ Separated CI and CD Workflows

### Problem
The monolithic `ci-cd.yml` file:
- Ran builds on every push and PR (wasteful)
- Mixed testing, building, and releasing logic
- Made it harder to understand when each job runs
- Didn't properly separate concerns

### Solution
Split into two separate workflows:

#### CI Workflow (`ci.yml`)
**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` branch
- All pull requests to `main`

**Jobs:**
1. **Test and Lint** - Run tests and code quality checks
2. **Build** - Build for all platforms (x64)
3. **Build ARM** - Build for ARM platforms

**Purpose:** Ensure code quality and that builds work on all platforms

#### CD Workflow (`cd.yml`)
**Triggers:**
- Push of version tags (`v*`)

**Jobs:**
1. **Release** - Wait for CI to pass, then create GitHub release with artifacts

**Purpose:** Deploy releases only when tagged and CI passes

### Architecture
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Push to main or PR                      │
│ ──────────────────────────────────────► │
│ Runs: CI workflow                       │
│   - Test & Lint                         │
│   - Build all platforms                 │
│   - Upload artifacts                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Push tag v*                             │
│ ──────────────────────────────────────► │
│ Runs: CD workflow                       │
│   1. Wait for CI to complete            │
│   2. Download CI artifacts              │
│   3. Create GitHub Release              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Result
- ✅ CI runs on all PRs and main pushes (quality gate)
- ✅ CD only runs on version tags after CI passes
- ✅ No duplicate builds - CD reuses CI artifacts
- ✅ Cleaner separation of concerns
- ✅ Easier to maintain and understand

**Files Modified:**
- Removed: `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
- Created: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Created: `.github/workflows/cd.yml`

## 4. ✅ Confirmed index.html is Required

### Question
"Do I really need the index.html at the root of my project on Tauri?"

### Answer
**YES, absolutely required!** ✅

### Explanation

The `index.html` at the project root is **essential** for Vite and Tauri integration:

1. **Vite Entry Point**: Vite uses `index.html` as the entry point for the build process
   ```html
   <script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>
   ```

2. **Build Process**:
   - `npm run dev` → Vite serves `index.html` at `http://localhost:1420`
   - `npm run build` → Vite transforms `index.html` and creates `dist/index.html`
   - Tauri loads from `dist/` folder (see `tauri.conf.json`: `"frontendDist": "../dist"`)

3. **Standard Vite Structure**:
   ```
   project/
   ├── index.html          ← Entry point (REQUIRED)
   ├── src/
   │   ├── main.tsx        ← React entry
   │   └── App.tsx
   ├── dist/               ← Build output
   │   └── index.html      ← Built version
   └── src-tauri/          ← Tauri backend
   ```

4. **Why it's at the root**: Vite convention - unlike Create React App or Next.js, Vite keeps `index.html` at the project root for simplicity and direct module imports.

### Result
- ✅ Keep `index.html` at project root
- ✅ Do not move or delete it
- ✅ This is standard Vite + Tauri architecture

**No files modified** - confirmed current structure is correct.

## Summary

All 4 issues addressed:

| Issue | Status | Impact |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Browse buttons not working | ✅ Fixed | All browse buttons now handle browser/Tauri modes correctly |
| dev-frontend runs install unnecessarily | ✅ Fixed | Faster development iteration |
| CI/CD not separated | ✅ Fixed | Cleaner workflow, better separation of concerns |
| index.html necessity | ✅ Confirmed | Required for Vite, no changes needed |

### Next Steps

1. **Test the browse buttons**: Refresh browser and try clicking browse buttons
2. **Test dev-frontend speed**: `make dev-frontend` should start faster now
3. **CI/CD workflows**: Will trigger on next push to main or when you create a version tag

## Development Quick Reference

```bash
# Fast frontend development (no install each time)
make dev-frontend

# Install dependencies when needed
make install

# Full Tauri testing (requires XQuartz on macOS)
make dev-tauri

# Create a release
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
# CD workflow automatically creates GitHub release
```
